    <h1>MISSION BRIEFING:</h1>
    <p>You are space truck&shy;ers on the star&shy;freighter&nbsp;<strong><em>USCSS Mon&shy;tero</em></strong>, run&shy;ning &quot;the Gaunt&shy;let&quot;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the trade route be&shy;tween&nbsp;<strong>Anchor&shy;point Sta&shy;tion</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>the Fron&shy;tier</strong>. Your ship's car&shy;go hold is packed with dozens of tanks of dan&shy;ger&shy;ous&nbsp;<strong>Tri&shy;tium gas</strong>&nbsp;that is in the pro&shy;cess of&nbsp;<strong>de&shy;cay&shy;ing into ex&shy;tremely pro&shy;fit&shy;able He&shy;lium&hyphen;3</strong>.</p>
    <p>Usually, car&shy;goes such as these are towed in mas&shy;sive tan&shy;ker mo&shy;dules, de&shy;signed to safely tran&shy;sport much higher con&shy;cen&shy;tra&shy;tions of the gas. The&nbsp;<em>Mon&shy;tero&nbsp;</em>isn't ra&shy;ted as a com&shy;mer&shy;cial tow&shy;ing ve&shy;hicle, how&shy;ever, and this small run is a spe&shy;cial or&shy;der for a&nbsp;<strong>Weyland&hyphen;Yutani cor&shy;por&shy;ate ac&shy;count</strong>&nbsp;on a newly&hyphen;established Fron&shy;tier col&shy;ony:&nbsp;<strong>Sut&shy;ter's World</strong>.</p>
    <p>While the trip so far has been fairly rou&shy;tine, the&nbsp;<em>Mon&shy;tero</em>'s sen&shy;sors de&shy;vel&shy;oped a glitch be&shy;fore you left Anchor&shy;point and spo&shy;rad&shy;ic&shy;ally pinged con&shy;tact with a sen&shy;sor re&shy;flec&shy;tion be&shy;fore you ac&shy;ti&shy;vated the dis&shy;place&shy;ment drive and went FTL.</p>
    <p>Your car&shy;go run so far has been with&shy;out in&shy;cid&shy;ent, your long slum&shy;ber in deep cryo un&shy;dis&shy;tur&shy;bed.</p>
