The M41A fires explosive-tip caseless standard light armor-penetrating US M309 rounds accelerated via electronic pulse. Remaining ammo is tracked via an LED counter and the rifle has two firing modes—burst and full automatic. For more about the grenade launcher, see its weapon card. An otherwise reliable weapon, the M41A can jam when fully-loaded, so partially loaded magazines are recommended. (In their downtime on mission Marines will take the time to remove a few rounds from each of the magazines they carry.) Even with this flaw, the M41A is what you want slung over your shoulder—but if you are a civilian, good luck getting a permit to own one.",EMLpA1aqmFMebJUF

What makes the M56A2 a smart gun is its ability to choose targets for you. It is equipped with an infrared tracking system and data transmitter/receiver that homes in on potential threats and sends that information to a Head Mounted Sight. Fire control is still at your discretion, so if you are running low on ammo, pick your targets. The M56A2 fires in either bursts or full automatic.

It is in common use by the USCMC, who deploy the weapon at the squad and fireteam level. Civilian models exist too.
